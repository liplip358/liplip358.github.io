Hi there! Welcome to my personal blog page. Here, I’ll be sharing posts about the things that spark my curiosity and passion.

If you come across something that resonates with you, I warmly welcome you to linger, reflect, and share the journey with me.

  In Which Everything Begins

I’m from Taiwan and currently a sophomore, majoring in a science and engineering field. Sometimes I feel a little lost, my grades aren’t always great, and I often wonder if I’m heading in the right direction, or if I’m even capable of making a difference.<br/>
That’s why I started this blog: to capture the little moments of daily life from now on. My hope is that, one day, I can look back and think, “Ah yes, that’s exactly what I did back then… how nostalgic!”

Here, I’ll share not only the cool discoveries I stumble upon, but also small thoughts and reflections I jot down along the way. The journey goes on, and sometimes it’s worth pausing to look back at how far we’ve come.
